JavaScript Fundamentals & DOM Manipulation Examples ✨
This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly web pages that demonstrate fundamental JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, arrays, objects, promises, and basic algorithms like filtering and calculations. Each HTML file serves as a standalone example, focusing on a specific topic.

📁 Examples Included
1. index.html + js/script.js 🚀
Purpose: Demonstrates core DOM manipulation and event handling techniques.
Key Features:

Visual feedback using onclick, onmouseenter, and onmouseleave.

Real-time text display and word count using onkeyup and onkeypress.

Simple calculator using two input values and a dropdown menu.

Interactive calculator UI with button-based input and evaluation.

Alerts on focus/blur events using onfocus and onblur.

Basic array display.

2. array.html + js/array.js 📊
Purpose: Demonstrates array operations and dynamic table manipulation.
Key Features:

Add subject and marks using input fields.

Append new rows to a table with an "Add Marks" button.

Display underlying array structure.

Calculate and show average score.

(Optional) "Action" column hints at row deletion features.

3. filters.html + js/filter.js 🔍
Purpose: Real-time data filtering using user input.
Key Features:

Live filtering with onkeyup.

Filters table rows based on search input.

Displays filtered data both in table and separately in a div.

4. object.html + js/object.js 🧩
Purpose: Explore object creation and manipulation.
Key Features:

Examples of object literals and constructors.

Accessing/modifying properties and using object methods.

💡 Output is primarily visible in the browser's Developer Console (F12).

5. promise.html + js/promise.js ⏳
Purpose: Demonstrates asynchronous JavaScript with Promises.
Key Features:

Simulates async tasks using setTimeout.

Implements .then() and .catch() handlers.

💡 Output is primarily visible in the browser's Developer Console (F12).
